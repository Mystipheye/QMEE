Information about file "Mating_Data_Days_1_-_10": 

This is a dataset from a mating experiment that I was a part of. The associated species was known as Drosophila melanogaster. The treatments were females being exposed to males that had been housed singly before, or males that had been housed with other males before.The males had 60 different genetic backgrounds. Mating trials were conducted over the course of 10 testing days, and the female from each treatment was introduced to a novel male during each mating trial that she took part in. The data is raw and needs to be cleaned up, and I shall do so while working with this dataset over the course of this semester. Biological questions that I would hope to answer using this dataset are "how does the prior experience of male Drosophila melanogaster affect their mating success with females?", and "how does genetic background of male Drosophila melanogaster affect their mating success with females?" Mating success would be determined using the measures of "mating duration and mating latency". Conducting ANOVA analyses, or more advanced related tests, would allow me to see if there are differences in mating success amongst the different treatments.
