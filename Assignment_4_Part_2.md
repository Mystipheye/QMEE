Hypotheses: I hypothesize that mating duration will be greater for males perceiving greater sperm competition 
(previously housed with rival males), than for males perceiving lower sperm competition (previously housed singly).
I also hypothesize that mating latency will be lower for males perceiving higher sperm competition, than for males
perceiving lower sperm competition. I plan on testing these two hypotheses statistically by using generalized mixed
linear models (GMLMs), applying a Gaussian (normal) distribution to these. Another hypothesis that I would make is 
that males perceiving higher sperm competition would delay the remating interval of their mates more than males 
perceiving lower sperm competition. This hypothesis would also be tested using a GMLM, but I'm not sure what 
distribution could be applied here. Perhaps a Gaussian distribution, or perhaps another binomial distribution. 
This is something I would have to figure out later.
